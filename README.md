# Complete Arch Linux Tutorial (KDE Plasma + Wayland w/ Automounting Partitions)

This is a OPINIONATED Arch installation guide for people that just want a working system to game on that's straight forward with a DE that is most like Windows
and usually the one most people want to use because of that, at least for their first DE. I've used every DE and WM that is both trendy and some obscure,
I started with KDE Plasma and Arch Linux. I always come back to both eventually. It's fun to try out new things, but KDE Plasma is OP at the moment I am writing 
this. It's fully featured, they finally have a good process in eliminating bugs which plagued the DE before, and it's very easy to customize. Most DEs and WMs have
some caveat, KDE Plasma does not. That is why I use it.

- A bootable Arch Linux USB (written with `dd` or similar)
- Internet connection
- UEFI system
