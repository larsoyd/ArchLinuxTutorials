# Complete Arch Linux Tutorial (GNOME + Wayland w/ Automounting Partitions)

This is a Arch installation guide for noobs **WITHOUT LUKS encryption and SecureBoot** who just want a working system to game on that's straight forward with GNOME.


## NOTE (ACTUALLY READ THIS): 

So, I like to use something called `systemd-gpt-auto-generator`. I acknowledge that this is a super opinionated decision for a noob tutorial, and I debated whether or not to use it in this tutorial, but I feel it's so cromulent and underrated that I decided to make a big decision to teach you how to use it as well. If you follow this guide correctly and use it you'll see why it's very convenient.
It is not usually done on Linux and it is kind of new(?), at least relative to `fstab`, however it is a modern way of mounting partitions that are also used by other operating systems you may already be familiar with. 

---

# INTRODUCTION - How GPT Auto-Mounting Works

Modern systemd uses `systemd-gpt-auto-generator` to automatically discover and mount partitions based on specific 128-bit **UUIDs,** eliminating the need for manual `/etc/fstab` entries. This system is useful for centralizing file system configuration in the partition table and making configuration in `/etc/fstab` or on the kernel command line unnecessary. This is similar to the OS you probably switched away from and are more familiar with; Windows. - Windows identifies volumes by what they call "GUIDs" (Volume{GUID} paths). Now for your sake all you need to know is that a GUID is functionally the same thing as the specific 128-bit UUIDs that we will use on Linux, but instead of mounting to `boot` or `root` they mount their "GUIDs" to set drives defined by a letter, so `C:` drives and `D:` drives. That is why some letters are reserved for largely depreciated functions, as mounting on Windows is identified by a set identifier just like your system's UUIDs will do.

Your drive partitions like `boot` and `root` will not be mounted by `fstab`, instead they will automount entirely by using UUIDs by using `systemd-gpt-auto-generator`. This is preferable in my opinion to `fstab` which feels like a hack and places too much control of system reliance upon a single text based config. This is anecdotal, but I have heard of what happens when some package or update randomly decides to destroy your `fstab` and it is **NOT** fun to troubleshoot if it happens. It's often difficult to know what is going wrong and many hours will be wasted until you realize your fstab for whatever reason is empty or has some typos.

Now this is still unconventional which is part of the fun of using this as it justifies the manual install, but since it is unique it's worth familiarizing yourself with how this works before following my guide. I will add a small tutorial on how you would go about adding a new SSD later on with this, it's a *tiny* bit different but still very easy to do. -- **PLEASE NOTE:** that there are extra steps to subvolumes if you choose to use this with **BTRFS,** since subvolumes like snapshots usually require `fstab`. I might write a small tutorial on what you need to do with BTRFS for this type of system if I ever decide to use that filesystem, but essentially instead of `fstab` you just use systemd service for each instead which is also what you will do for new drives. 

## The UUIDs

When you use the partition type codes in this guide:
- `EF00` (EFI System Partition)
- `8304` (Linux x86-64 root)  

systemd automatically creates mount units based on these partition type UUIDs. Each hex code corresponds to a specific 128-bit UUID that tells the system exactly what that partition is for. The system recognizes these GUIDs and then mounts accordingly, just like a modern system should. This approach is similar to how partitioning works on other systems.
For extra storage you can use the generic Linux filesystem code:
- `8300`

systemd won't auto-mount these, giving you control over when and where they mount which again to me is ideal, if need be you can mount them on boot with a systemd service. This allows you to avoid `fstab` issues forever. No more random issues where it's suddenly overwritten for some reason or anything else, mounting is seperate and automated.

---

# - CONS: -

Same Disk Only: Auto-mounting only works for partitions on the same physical disk as your root partition.

Boot Loader Dependency: The boot loader must set the `LoaderDevicePartUUID` EFI variable for root partition detection to work. systemd-boot (used in this guide) supports this. Check if the bootloader you wish to use does.
For GRUB to set the `LoaderDevicePartUUID` UEFI variable load the bli module in grub.cfg:
```ini
if [ "$grub_platform" = "efi" ]; then
  insmod bli
fi
```

First Partition Rule: systemd mounts the first partition of each type it finds. If you have multiple 8302 partitions on the same disk, **then only the first one gets auto-mounted.**

No Multi-Disk Support: This won't work on systems where the root filesystem is distributed across multiple disks (like BTRFS RAID).

# - PROS: -

Portability: Your disk image can boot on different hardware without `fstab` changes

Self-Describing: The partition table contains all mounting information

Container-Friendly: Tools like systemd-nspawn can automatically set up filesystems from GPT images

Reduced Maintenance: No broken boots from typos in `/etc/fstab` or random updates doing weird stuff messing with it.

## What I will mainly be using/setting:

- systemd-automount for GPT partitions 
- GNOME on Wayland
- NVME SSD
- `linux-zen` default kernel which is a kernel optimized for desktop use.
- `linux-lts` for a fallback and debug kernel
- zsh default shell
- systemd-boot with UKIs
- zswap with a 16 GiB swap file
- EXT4 for `/`
- AMD CPU + NVIDIA GPU w/ `nvidia-open-dkms` 
**NOTE:** This tutorial assumes you have a Turing (NV160/TUXXX) and newer	card for current driver. Check your card first.

NVIDIA modeset is set by default, and according to the wiki setting fbdev manually is now unnecessary so I will not set those. PLEASE check the wiki before install for anything. **POST-INSTALL GUIDE IS SUPER OPINIONATED, FOLLOW BY OWN VOLITION.**

*Protip:* This tutorial uses Norwegian keymaps and locale/timezone settings. Simply replace those with your own (e.g. keymap, `LANG`, `TZ`).
If you use an English lang keyboard you can ignore all of it, but it's worth knowing if you are new and use a different keyboard like say `de-latin1` for German keyboards.

**NOTE:** **This tutorial assumes you have a NVME SSD,** which are named `/dev/nvme0n1`. If you don't have that, it's something else. If you don't know, check with `lsblk -l` to see your scheme. It could be `sda` or something else. If it is something else replace all instances of `nvme0n1` and remove the `p` from  `${d}p1` in the formatting.

*Sidenote:* Unless you like the name, replace my hostname (basically the name of your rig) of `BigBlue` with yours, same as my user name `lars` if your name ain't Lars. Though if it is, cool. Hi! I thought about doing placeholders but I feel those are more distracting usually, I prefer to see how something would actually work in a guide, maybe you do as well?


## Prerequisites

- A bootable Arch Linux USB (written with `dd` or similar)
- Internet connection
- UEFI system

### TUTORIAL PROPER

**GPT Auto-Mount + GNOME (Wayland) + NVIDIA**

> **Prerequisites:** This guide assumes you have an AMD processor with NVIDIA graphics.



## Step 0: Boot from ISO

Set up your keyboard layou if you're not on an US keyboard, and verify UEFI boot:

```bash
# Set your keyboard layout, you can skip this is u use a normal keyboard (US)
# each line in these code blocks is a separate line in the terminal FYI

# # List all keymaps (scrollable):
localectl list-keymaps | less

# or filter by country code by writing:
localectl list-keymaps | grep -i -E 'no'                   # Norway example
                                                           # "no" is our ISO-639 code. Find yours by googling first
                                                           # Then replace 'no' with your country code                 

# For Norway it's "no-latin1". On Arch it's usually "*-latin1" and not just the country code.
# Test out your keyboard after this, if it is wrong try another on the list.
#
# To write "-" on US keyboard which you will need to do to be able to write this command,
# it's usually the first key left of backspace. For Norwegian/Nordic keyboard that's: \.
loadkeys no-latin1

# the default font for an arch install is tiny and it only gets worse as you get older
# here is how you get it to something readable
setfont ter-118n

# if that is not big enough try this:
setfont ter-132n    

# and if even that is not big enough:
setfont -d ter-132n  

# Verify UEFI firmware, write it all out including && and echo.
# It's just going to be a bunch of random variables that's confusing, however...
#
# If it says the quote at the end there then you are good.
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars && echo "UEFI firmware detected"

# Sync system clock
timedatectl set-ntp true

# --- Web Test (wired & Wi-Fi) ---

# See your links & their state (names like enpXsY for Ethernet, wlan0 for Wi-Fi)
ip link           # interface listing
networkctl list   # networkd's view; "configured" with DHCP is what you want

---

Ethernet:

# If you're on Ethernet, DHCP should be automatic on the ISO.
# You can confirm an IPv4/IPv6 address like:
networkctl status | sed -n '1,80p'   # look for "Address:" and "Gateway:"

---

Wi-Fi:

# If you're on Wi-Fi, (1) make sure nothing is soft-blocked, (2) connect with iwctl.
rfkill list
rfkill unblock all         # if you see "Soft blocked: yes" for wlan      (safe to run always)

# Discover your wireless device name (often "wlan0" on ISO)
iwctl device list          

# Scan & connect (replace SSID if your AP name has spaces keep the quotes)
iwctl station "YOUR-DEV" scan
iwctl station "YOUR-DEV" get-networks
iwctl station "YOUR-DEV" connect "YOUR-SSID"   # iwctl will prompt for passphrase

---

# DNS & IP sanity checks (these distinguish raw IP reachability vs DNS resolution)
ping -c 3 1.1.1.1            # raw IP reachability (no DNS involved)
resolvectl query archlinux.org
ping -c 3 archlinux.org

# HTTPS test (TLS & HTTP working)
curl -I https://archlinux.org  # expect "HTTP/2 200" (or 301/302)

# Time sync sanity (NTP via systemd-timesyncd)
timedatectl status | sed -n '1,12p'  # look for "System clock synchronized: yes"
```

## Step 1: Partition the NVMe drive with systemd-repart

```bash
lsblk -l

# Set the device you want to operate on
d=/dev/nvme0n1   # change if lsblk shows a different path

# Define the desired partitions for systemd-repart using nano
mkdir -p /tmp/repart.d
```

```bash
# Create 10-esp.conf
nano /tmp/repart.d/10-esp.conf

# 10-esp.conf
[Partition]
Type=esp
Label=EFI
Format=vfat
SizeMinBytes=2G
SizeMaxBytes=2G
```

```bash
# Create 20-root.conf
nano /tmp/repart.d/20-root.conf

# 20-root.conf
[Partition]
Type=root
Label=root
Format=ext4
```

```bash
# Preview the plan 
systemd-repart --definitions=/tmp/repart.d --empty=force "$d"

# Apply the changes for real. Pick ONE of these options.
#
# OPTION A) Normally without fast_commit:
#
systemd-repart --definitions=/tmp/repart.d --dry-run=no --empty=force "$d"

---

# OPTION B) If you want `fast_commit` enabled you run this command.
#
# ext4 has a faster journaling system called fast_commit
# According to the Arch wiki it supposedly improves performance:
#
SYSTEMD_REPART_MKFS_OPTIONS_EXT4='-O fast_commit' \
  systemd-repart --definitions=/tmp/repart.d --dry-run=no --empty=force "$d"

---

# Optional: verify results
lsblk -f "$d"

# Optional: verify fast_commit results
# You should see fast_commit listed under features:
tune2fs -l /dev/disk/by-label/root | grep features

# optional, stronger check:
dumpe2fs -h /dev/disk/by-label/root | grep -i 'Fast commit length'
```

## Step 2: Mount filesystems (labels match your original layout)

```bash
# Mount root first
mount /dev/disk/by-label/root /mnt
```

#### Create and mount EFI directory with strict masks

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/efi
mount -o fmask=0177,dmask=0077,noexec,nodev,nosuid /dev/disk/by-label/EFI /mnt/efi
```

### Here is some information on why I am mounting EFI like this:

```md
Those options are a security-friendly way to mount the EFI System Partition.
They won’t get in your way for normal use.

fmask=0177 and dmask=0077: VFAT does not store Unix permissions.
These masks tell the kernel how to fake them: files become 600 (owner read/write, no exec),
directories 700 (owner only).

In other words, only root can read or write there, and files are not marked executable.
They are the right defaults for an EFI partition and won’t interfere with normal operation.

noexec: blocks running programs from that filesystem. 
nodev: device files on that filesystem are not treated as devices. 
nosuid: any setuid or setgid bit is ignored, so binaries there cannot gain elevated privileges. 
```

---


## Step 3: Base System Install

First update mirrorlist for optimal download speeds, obv replace Norway and Germany.
A good rule of thumb here is doing your country + closest neighbours and then a few larger neighbours after that.
So for me it's Norway,Sweden,Denmark then Germany,Netherlands:

```bash
# Update mirrorlist before install so you install with fastest mirrors
#
# PROTIP: "\" is a pipe, it basically is a fancy way to add a space to a bash command.
# So essentially just write each line until there isnt a "\" and it will run it all as one command.
# This is good for keeping large commands digestible during install.
#
reflector \ # this is a line, press enter                                      
      --country 'Norway,Sweden,Denmark,Germany,Netherlands' \  # and it goes to the 2nd line, do same as first
      --age 12 \ # same here & etc under  
      --protocol https \ 
      --sort rate \
      --latest 10 \
      --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist  # then when pressing enter here w/o "\" it will run all the lines

# When you understand all of this you can use a faster version of this
# that I like to use:
reflector -c NO,SE,DK,DE,NL -a 12 -p https \
-l 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# NOTE: This is slower but you will guaranteed have the best mirrors if you do this
# if you want to test the mirrors by speed do this:
reflector -c NO,SE,DK,DE,NL -a 12 -p https \
--sort rate --fastest 10 --download-timeout 10 --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

and then **Install the base of Arch Linux!** :

```bash
# For AMD CPUs:
pacstrap /mnt base linux-zen linux-lts linux-firmware amd-ucode nano sudo zsh
```

## Step 4: System Configuration

### 4.1 Enter the New System

```bash
# However before you can say you've installed arch you need to configure the system
# This is how you chroot into your newly installed system:
#
arch-chroot /mnt
```

### 4.2 Set Timezone

```bash
# Set timezone to your own continent and city
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Oslo /etc/localtime

# Set hardware clock
hwclock --systohc
```

### 4.3 Configure Locale

```bash
# Now we are going to configure our system language.
# I am going to have my system be in English,
# but my time and date will be set as it is in Norway.
# So an English system with a DD/MM/YYYY and 00:00 "military clock".
#
nano /etc/locale.gen

# Go down the list and uncomment both:
Uncomment: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 # English
Uncomment: nb_NO.UTF-8 UTF-8 # Bokmål Norwegian (replace with your own or leave out)

# Then generate locales
locale-gen

# Set system locale
nano /etc/locale.conf

# add
LANG=en_US.UTF-8    # LANG for system language
LC_TIME=nb_NO.UTF-8 # LC_TIME for date & time to my specific LANG default


# Set console keymap & font
nano /etc/vconsole.conf

# add
KEYMAP=no-latin1 # Skip this if US keyboard
FONT=ter-118n  # But add this.
               # This is a console font which makes it larger,
               # and more easily readable on boot

```

### 4.4 Set Hostname and Hosts

```bash
# Set hostname, echo lets you do it quickly w/o using nano
# good for one line stuff
#
echo "BigBlue" > /etc/hostname

# Configure hosts file
nano /etc/hosts

## add to /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1 localhost BigBlue
::1       localhost
```

### 4.5 Create User Account

```bash
# Set root password
passwd

# Create user with necessary groups
useradd -m -G wheel lars
passwd lars

# Set zsh as default shell for user and root
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh lars
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

# Enable sudo for wheel group
EDITOR=nano visudo
# Uncomment: %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

### Configure Initramfs

```bash
# Edit mkinitcpio configuration
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

---

# Example for MODULES:
MODULES=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)

---

# Example for HOOKS
HOOKS=(base systemd autodetect microcode modconf keyboard sd-vconsole block filesystems fsck)

# Key changes:
# - MUST use 'systemd' instead of 'udev' 
# - Use 'sd-vconsole' instead of 'keymap' and 'consolefont'
# - Remove 'kms' from HOOKS=() also if you use nvidia
# - Ensure microcode is in HOOKS=()
#
# NOTE: IF you do not remove udev and if you do not replace it with systemd,
# THEN YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT BOOT.
# This is the only pitfall with systemd-gpt-auto-generator,
#
# It's worth doublechecking.
# Check this again if your system isn't booting post-install.

```

### Install UKIs and Configure Bootloader

```bash
# Install systemd-boot
#
# NOTE: Remember to include `--variables=yes` flag. - Here's why:
# Starting with systemd version 257, bootctl began detecting
# environments like arch-chroot as containers...
#
# This is an intended change and without it, it silently skips
# the step of writing EFI variables to NVRAM...
#
# For non-nerds: This prevents issues where the boot entry
# might not appear in the firmware's boot menu...
#
bootctl install --esp-path=/efi --variables=yes

# Minimal cmdline with kernel option(s)
nano /etc/kernel/cmdline

# These are the only kernel flags needed for this setup
# With GPT Autoloader you do not need to specify UUIDs here
#
# rootflags add options to the root filesystem, like noatime
# noatime is a typical optimization for EXT4 systems.
# nowatchdog is also optimization. Both of them are unneeded for single use desktops.
# they are on for "over-security"/kernel default reasons only.
# many distros ship with nowatchdog and noatime, EOS for example.
#
# if you really are worried about if you need them (you probably dont) then you can
# research them independently
#
# loglevel=3 just increases verbosity in logging.
#
# zswap.compressor=lz4 switches compressor to lz4 from zstd, lz4 is considered faster
#
## /etc/kernel/cmdline
rw rootflags=noatime nowatchdog loglevel=3 zswap.compressor=lz4
```

#### Make the ESP directory
```bash
# Make ESP directory
mkdir -p /efi/EFI/Linux
```

#### Edit the mkinitcpio presets so they write UKIs to the ESP

```bash
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-zen.preset

# Content:
ALL_kver="/boot/vmlinuz-linux-zen"
PRESETS=('default')

default_uki="/efi/EFI/Linux/arch-linux-zen.efi"
```

#### Repeat for LTS:

```bash
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-lts.preset

# Content:
ALL_kver="/boot/vmlinuz-linux-lts"
PRESETS=('default')

default_uki="/efi/EFI/Linux/arch-linux-lts.efi"

```

#### Build the UKIs / This writes both kernel *.efi's into ESP/EFI/Linux/:

```bash
mkinitcpio -P
```

#### Configure bootloader

```bash
# write the loader
nano /efi/loader/loader.conf

## add to loader
timeout 10
console-mode auto
editor no
```

# 4.6 Install the System

```bash
# Update package database
pacman -Syu
```

### Install Packages
```bash
# pipe commands, like before type out each pipe line, press enter on each until base-devel
# then when u press enter it installs it all
pacman -S --needed \
  networkmanager reflector xorg xorg-init xterm \
  pipewire pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack wireplumber \
  linux-zen-headers linux-lts-headers \
  nvidia-open-dkms nvidia-utils libva-nvidia-driver libva-utils cuda \
  terminus-font ttf-dejavu ttf-liberation \
  pacman-contrib git wget \
  base-devel
```

### Enable Essential Services

```bash
systemctl enable NetworkManager systemd-timesyncd systemd-boot-update.service reflector.timer 
```

```bash
# Exit chroot environment
exit

# Unmount all partitions
umount -R /mnt

# Reboot into new system
shutdown now

# Remove ArchISO USB from computer then boot back into new install

---

### 4.9 Create swap file & Configure Zswap

```bash
# Create a 16 GiB swap file and initialize it in one step.
#   --size 16G   -> allocate a 16 GiB file
#   --file       -> create the file with correct mode and real blocks
#   -U clear     -> clear any existing UUID in the header
mkswap -U clear --size 16G --file /swapfile
```

edit:
```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/swapfile.swap
```
and add:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Swap file

[Swap]
What=/swapfile
Priority=100

[Install]
WantedBy=swap.target
```
then:
```bash
systemctl enable swapfile.swap
```

Optimizations for swap use:

```bash
# These are optimizations taken from the wiki.
# Generally considered to be optimal.
nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-zswap.conf

# add
vm.swappiness = 100
vm.page-cluster = 0
vm.watermark_boost_factor = 0
vm.watermark_scale_factor = 125

# update the sysctl
sysctl --system
```

### 4.10 Enable Other Services

```bash
systemctl enable fstrim.timer reflector.timer pkgstats.timer
```
